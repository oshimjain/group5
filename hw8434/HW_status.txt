///
Explanation: This 'git status' command returned multiple bits of information. The first line 'on branch main' indicates that we are  the main branch of the remote repository. The second line 'Your branch is....' indicates that we have all the current files and      already downloaded. Then, on the fourth line, we see a message indicating untracked files followed by all my local files that have not been pushed to the remote repository. On our  introduction to git day, I had made multiple files in an attempt to do the exersise. I will delete them promptly. We also see the HW_noadd.txt which was part of this exercise. The final line states again that we have untracked files but also that there is nothing to be committed.
