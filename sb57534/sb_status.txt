Below is the pasted contnt from git status:

login4.frontera(450)$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        sb57534/sb_noadd.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

==================================
Explanation:
Since I have not created a branch to make my changes, I am directly fiddling with the main branch. That is reflected in the message "On branch main".
Now, because I did the last push, and before that, I had pulled all changes from the remote main, Git now indicates to me that my local version of the main branch is up to date and in sync with the remote main, denoted by origin/main.
Additionally, since the no_add.txt file is not supposed to be pushed to the remote, it lies as a file untracked by Git, in other words, a local file in my directory. Hence it is listed in the list of untracked files.
Between doing the "git push" and the "git status", I have not made any file changes, nor added any new files for Git to track. Thus, it says that nothing is added for git to commit. However, since some files are not tracked, it does not know whether I may or may not have made changes to those files, and so gives me a useful prompt to add the untracked files.
